The data set in the file represents the output data of the air brake system after the fault of the system, and the specific data set is described as follows:

ABS_1s：The simulation time is set to 12s, the noise is set toGaussian white noise, the fault injection time Tf is 1s, and the pre-control pressure of the air brake system is 300kPa within 0-7s and 0kPa within 7-12s. The degree and location of  these faults are described in the article.
