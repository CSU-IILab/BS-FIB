# Data description

The repository provides sensor deviation fault data, sensor gain fault data, brake cylinder air leakage fault data, train pipe air leakage fault data, and EP valve spring fault data generated after injecting faults into the air brake system. In addition, the repository provides fault data generated after the faulty air brake system is put into the entire high-speed train brake system.

Data set1 is the output data of the air brake system after injection fault. Data set is the data after the faulty air brake system is put into the brake system of the whole high-speed train.
