## 1 Data description

The repository provides sensor deviation fault data, sensor gain fault data, brake cylinder air leakage fault data, train pipe air leakage fault data, and EP valve spring fault data generated after injecting faults into the air brake system. In addition, the repository provides fault data generated after the faulty air brake system is put into the entire high-speed train brake system.
